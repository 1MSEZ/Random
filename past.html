        <h2>obsessed with tech.</h2>
        <p class="info"> Windows 98 was the first ever computer operating system I've ever used, then Windows 2000, XP,
            7,
            8, now 10.</br>
            I used to take apart phones, toys, things that have a electric circuit board, then put them back again. I
            wondered, what made them so special.</br>
            Still remember the first time I touched a computer, a summer day in 2002. My uncle bought an IBM PC,
            where I fell in love with what's inside the digital world. For me, it was magical.</br>
        </p>
        <h2>education.</h2>
        <p class="info">Obtained Certificate II in Information Technology in High School.</br>
            I dropped out of High School because I felt hopeless in the year of 2016, so I went to TAFE and got my
            Certificate III, IV and Diploma in Information Technology.(2016 - 2018)</p>

        <h2>experience.</h2>
        <p class="info">Before I moved to Sydney, I worked as a technician at a small computer shop back in Perth.</br>
            Troubleshooting issues and building different kind of computers makes me happy, it motivates me look forward
            for
            another day.</br>
            I am happy to learn all kinds of programming language and try out different operating systems, I have taught
            myself how to write in Python, JavaScript, HTML, C# and with limited knowledge in Java.</p>
